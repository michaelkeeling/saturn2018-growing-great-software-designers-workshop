# Concrete methods/advice/approaches

## At my company we do ...

* tech ladder with design skills and behaviors [which requires a] 
  demonstrated history [of success]

* apply design thinking with user in the center

* write architecture descision records (ADR) wichih makes the decision 
  process visible

* share architecture patterns

* after sprint design review and ADR

* pre-mortems to identify possible failures
  * public design evaluation
  * make things visible/explicit

* Enterprise architecture network 
  * business and software architecture, responsibilities 

* Senior designers match junior designers and projects to grow
  their skills / skill gaps

* Send people to training based on skill gaps

* Friday 1/2 day tech experimentation
