# Concrete methods/advice/approaches

## At my company we do ...

* tech ladder with design skills and behaviors [which requires a] 
  demonstrated history [of success]

* apply design thinking with user in the center

* write architecture descision records (ADR) wichih makes the decision 
  process visible

* share architecture patterns

* after sprint design review and ADR

* pre-mortems to identify possible failures
  * public design evaluation
  * make things visible/explicit

* Enterprise architecture network 
  * business and software architecture, responsibilities 

* Senior designers match junior designers and projects to grow
  their skills / skill gaps

* Send people to training based on skill gaps

* Friday 1/2 day tech experimentation

* Innovation days, no "real work" Hackathon

* Internal tech talks

* Experiments for Quality Attributes

## Ideal companies do ..

* Identifies skills progression and guide people to training

* (Meta) make design process visible and evolvable

* Has a book group to discuss design ideas

* (Meta) Acknowledge and value architecture design

* (Meta) Design processes are group effort

## Old stodgy companies do ...

* (Anti-pattern) Architecture certification and exams

## Other points

* designers growing with new practices

* observation: tension between rigidity and flexibility in regard to what
  should designers know, how we guide their growth?

* (Anti-pattern) bad companies have corporate governance that stifles 
  innovation

* (Anti-pattern) bad companies don't allow learning through failure

* Design documents and reviews
