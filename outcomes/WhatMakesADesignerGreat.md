# What makes a designer great?

We started off the discussion by identifying a set of skills that we feel characterize great designers. Some of these skills are hard (technical skills), some are soft skills. After further diving into the different skills, we found that some of these skills are teachable while others have to come from within (i.e. something you are "born with").

## Technical/hard skills

The technical skills we discussed were most teachable:
* API Design
* Domain modelling
* Design patterns
* How to write documentation
* Awareness of trends
* Relevant skills (e.g. java skills if you are designing for java)
* Eliciting, refining, analysing Quality Attributes, including identifying a chaperon/stakeholder for those Quality Attributes
* Forensics/Archeology skills to build on what we have
* Design Language
* Ability to acquire skills quickly
* A "silver" toolbox of tools to apply to different needs

All these skills are context dependent, i.e. different technical/organizational environments will have different technical skills requirements.

## Soft skills
The soft skills are a mix of teachable (T) and inherent skills (I)

* (T/I) Ability to abstract information and apply in new contexts. We related this to Kramer's work on abstractions (https://www.ics.uci.edu/~andre/informatics223s2007/kramer.pdf). Abstractions skills to level 3 can be thaught, but the breakthrough to level 4 needs to happen from within.
* (T) Communication
* (T) Design Thinking
* (I) Curiosity
* (I) Humbleness - more interested in the outcome than being right
* (T) Ability to make trade-offs
* (T) Ability to get ideas out of your head effectively
* (I) Elegance - everyone knows it when they see it, but nobody can articulate it
* (T) Reflections
* (I) Scientific mindset
* (I) Create a mesh network and not a hub and spoke network between other designers
* (T) Leadership
* (T) Diversity of experience
* (I) Trustworthy
* (I) Passion for life long learning

## Mentoring
We also had a discussion on what has helped us as designers (but are we great?)
* A key recurrence was the availability of a great mentor
* Diversity of experiences with different(?) mentors
* Feedback loops on previous designs
