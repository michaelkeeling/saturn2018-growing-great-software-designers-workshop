# Why don’t they give a shit?

## Practices for designers
Collaborate with peers about act of design not only the design itself

Drive to change the world around them (the designers)

 - Pre-requisite for ”great designer”?
 - Solve the problem even when it doesn’t make sense - seek out the real problem

## Challenges

Lack of awareness, caring for conceptual integrity

Failure mode: ”But it solves the problem.. Why can’t I do it?”
* You can’t reason about it

Why don’t they get it (reference to Jochem Schulenkloppers earlier SATURN talk)
* They being the business (management). We have to talk their language.

Dealing with children: you gotta wear underwear.
* Enabling apathy?
* Surrounded by safety nets - someone else will take care of it
* Art of letting go
* Use Tech Debt?

Non-designers (or children) can’t see the benefits of what designers propose.

## Models for communication

Not speaking in a way that they understand it.

* Four basic behavior patterns (DISC)
* Talk to them the way they do (way of communication, not only words/vocabulary)
* Relationship is better
* Two mental models in communication: open/closed and case/person

Kanemans’ explanation of humans + risk

”They care because you care.”

Tell stories so people understand

## Organizational circumstances for great design

How can we align incentives across different functions in the organization?
 - Quick & cheap versus value in (some) design up-front
 - Establish shared values

Why do people go along with the CTO?
* How many have felt the thrill of code aligned with the problem, avoiding failures?
What does the organization value?
 - Do they celebrate fixing mistakes or preventing them?

Agile environment: manufacture crises?
* Assuming the team can deal with it?
