# How do we identify designers?

Problem: We are training 10 people to end up with 1 great designer

Question: Why can't we grow everyone?

Answer: We have limited resources. We want to invest in the most promising candidates

## Techniques

* Look at past performance
  * Treat projects as experiments, with the caveat that all projects are different
* Look for revealing personality traits, see [What makes a designer great?](what-makes-a-designer-great.md) for examples
  * We could use psych tests, though we want to be careful not to exclude those who don't fit a personality profile
  * An open mind and analytical thinking are important
* Find those who take ownership of projects
  * Start with those who opt in by being vocal about design
  * but beware of imposter syndrome and seek out others who have the skills but don't say so
* Find those that reflect on their failures
* Look for "elegance" in design, not somebody handing in an API that takes 44 string arguments where order matters
* Look for the ability to explain design rationale, rather than "I chose a tool from my box because it looked cool"
* Look for designs that focus on possible failures, rather than just the happy path cases
* Look for a hacker mentality
  * A good designer can figure out how a metal detector works at an airport, and defeat them by walking slowly and with their hands up
  * This shows good analytical inference

There was some discussion about avoiding unconscious bias when identifying potential designers.  There was a strong believe  among the group that everyone can be a _good_ designer, but not that necessarily everyone _should_ be or _wants_ to be a designer, or that everyone can be a "great" designer.  One metaphor that seemed to illustrate this point well: not everyone can (or wants) to play violin in the orchestra (and an orchestra of only violins would be quite awful), all instruments must work together to play a piece.  Extending this metaphor further, children in some countries are introduced to instruments by allowing them to play with any instruments they want at first.  Perhaps there is something we can do in this vein to identify design candidates (e.g. rotations in job roles that encourage career exploration).
