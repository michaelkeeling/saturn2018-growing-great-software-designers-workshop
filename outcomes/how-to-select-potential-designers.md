# How do we identify designers?

Problem: We are training 10 people to end up with 1 great designer

Question: Why can't we grow everyone?

Answer: We have limited resources. We want to invest in the most promising candidates

# Techniques

* Look at past performance
  * Treat projects as experiments, with the caveat that all projects are different
* Look for revealing personality traits, see [What makes a designer great?](what-makes-a-designer-great.md) for examples
  * We could use psych tests, though we want to be careful not to exclude those who don't fit a personality profile
  * An open mind and analytical thinking are important
* Find those who take ownership of projects
  * Start with those who opt in by being vocal about design
  * but beware of imposter syndrome and seek out others who have the skills but don't say so
* Find those that reflect on their failures
* Look for "elegance" in design, not somebody handing in an API that takes 44 string arguments where order matters
* Look for the ability to explain design rationale, rather than "I chose a tool from my box because it looked cool"
* Look for designs that focus on possible failures, rather than just the happy path cases
* Look for a hacker mentality
  * A good designer can figure out how a metal detector works at an airport, and defeat them by walking slowly and with their hands up
  * This shows good analytical inference
